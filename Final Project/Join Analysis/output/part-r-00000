He set a time of 4-5pm and  never showed up. Called to follow up at 6 pm and he asked for the address again. Never did hear back. Very poor communication. Now we are stuck with a broken sink until after the holidays. Should have called one of the first rate company's to begin with. At least they would have kept their scheduled time.

48vDKZjZYKtZhre3SfnUhA,"JMAC Plumbing & Air Conditioning",Las Vegas,5.0	Tip: If renting be sure to get permission from management first (it's a bummer if you don't). My review is on CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLY. Dan was both patient and kind!! He seems very knowledgeable and eager to do his job, which is a HUGE plus! I received very good vibes from him when setting up our appointment, which is a good thing, because some people can seem like creeps. When I had to, unexpectedly and unfortunately, cancel our appointment, I actually felt bad about it because he was so nice!

They also offer skydiving off the hot air ballon, so if you're an adrenaline junky and want something new to try Do This! I promise you won't regret it.

It seemed a bit sketchy to me being one open room with a few chairs in it. No doctor on site that I could see.  Just young staff administering medical IV.  I'm not sure what Nevada laws are but if I decide to get another IV I'll be going to a real medical office where you'd find a trained medical doctor on staff.

MgaFkl7CTZZfXUJ79FIWGQ,"Boyz II Men",Las Vegas,5.0	The theater is small enough to have a good view anywhere but to up your B2M experience and take it up a notch, select center seats and close to the front so that your lady friend can put herself in the best position to get a rose from one of these fine gents. You can thank me later.

If you are looking for some honest, hard-working and generally nice guys call five star movers. They absolutely live up to their name.
MlUS2LiVNaJBLdK5U565Kw,"Five Star Moving",Las Vegas,5.0	Beware! I purchases a living social voucher for 2 hours of moving services. Nowhere did it say that they have a 3 hour minimum. When I called to schedule my 2 hour moving service, they told me I had to purchase a third hour at the rate of $120 per hour, and that does not include the truck. I only needed 2 hours since it was a small job and less than a mile away. Sneaky tactic. Very misleading.

OawTcIafwcfa2gzBzf1Rbg,"Ocean Furniture",Las Vegas,5.0	"Free delivery only matters when they actually remember who you are and what you ordered. You'd think that much would be the easy part, especially in such a quiet, boring, no-traffic locale -- but to quote the owner --  they ""have a LOT of customers, so ...."
OawTcIafwcfa2gzBzf1Rbg,"Ocean Furniture",Las Vegas,5.0	Ken is lauded in these reviews, but has less than zero customer service skills when it comes down to saying more than the price points for what he already has in stock. If you give your number expecting feedback or an ETA on what you want, expect to be absolutely forgotten -- even if you're proactive and check in with him. Absolutely embarrassing attempt at meeting even HIS OWN barebones promises. STAY AWAY!

Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,"Dreikosen Door Service",Las Vegas,5.0	Photo eyes are a common problem on your operator system. They need to be aligned, or your electric operator will not go down. The LED lights on your photo eyes should be constantly lite with no flickering. If they are blinking, flickering or not on at all, they are out of alignment. However, you can override the safety system by keeping constant pressure on the wall button, but you must have those lights on solid or the operator will not go down ;)
Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,"Dreikosen Door Service",Las Vegas,5.0	Make sure and get maintenance on your door every 5 years or sooner. This will prevent problems from occurring due to spring tension decreasing and hinges or rollers breaking. Always make sure all your moving parts are lubricated to receive optimal performance :)

Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,"Dreikosen Door Service",Las Vegas,5.0	Nylon ball bearing rollers really increase the operation of your door. Stock rollers are plastic, (generally black) and unless lubricated on a consistent basis, they sqeak a high pitch and dont turn well, or sometimes not at all. Upgrading to a nylon ball bearing roller will allow the door to roll freely. The bearings are packed w\/ grease so there is no maintenance. The sqeaks are no longer.

Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,"Dreikosen Door Service",Las Vegas,5.0	When calling, if you don't get an answer, text me instead. It's easier for me to text you back instead of talking while I'm in the middle of a service call. Thanks
Ta9m6G8P0pA5nuAJomjQqQ,"Dreikosen Door Service",Las Vegas,5.0	Don't let other companies tell you that they have higher cycle springs. They don't. It's an attempt to make you believe they have better springs. But it's a flat out LIE!!!

hhEyi01cDddYJWQpKyxqAw,"A Hope Bail Bonds",Las Vegas,5.0	If you want to do the bail by phone, just have your debit or credit card ready. If you have ten minutes and can answer a few questions about your buddy in jail, they'll really get 'em out over the phone like their site says. Jail takes their time releasing inmates but at least they post bonds quick.  I was pleasantly surprised.

I guess I'll buy online from someone else.                                            Tip to the customer: If you need help, maybe scream real loud? Lol

Rick, the owner said after arriving to my home that he'd have to charge me extra to power scrub certain areas, but promised the areas would look great. Well, the areas were still discolored in those spots and he still wanted me to pay for it yet wouldn't write the extra charges on the receipt just the ""yelp deal"" and kept asking me to write a 5 star review on yelp. He rushed through. I paid cash, felt ripped off and refuse a review to someone who begs for it."

qHQPvp6pZ75fB63kOKUPqg,"Carpet Monkeys",Las Vegas,5.0	Rick left my carpets including the tile floor soaking wet. It's cheaper to rent an extractor from Ahern and do it yourself. I was charged extra for services he couldn't even do. His small cleaner is as good as a Rug Doctor you'd rent from the grocery store. Don't let the reviews by ppl with no picture or very few reviews fool you.

Best way I can describe this show is that if Blue Man Group, Absinthe, and An American Horror Story had a baby, this would be it. Not recommended for kids due to adult language and numerous sexual references. Viewer discretion is advised. Definitely no other show like it in Vegas.
